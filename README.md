## Description

Applying for jobs is a rough experience, and it gets rougher the older and more experienced you get. Customizing the
resume for the role you're applying for is time-consuming and tedious. That is the problem that Resumadeit aims to
solve.

Here's how it will work:

1. Create a Resumadeit account
2. Enter the list of employers you've worked for
3. Enter the complete list of skills you have
4. For each employer, list the role(s) you held
5. For each role, enter your accomplishments in that role and link your skills to those accomplishments

This builds a database of your work history and tags that history with your skills. This is the tedious bit, but we
only make you do it once!

Once you've completed your profile, generate your resume:

1. Log into Resumadeit
2. Click the "Export Resume..." button
3. Select the skills you want to highlight
4. Click Export

A resume featuring the employers, roles, and accomplishments that match the skills you selected will be downloaded.
